 * Rules this copy follows — keep them when editing:
 *   - Only describe what the platform really does: GGFIX connects customers to
 *     partner repair shops within 20 km; pickup is offered by pickup-enabled
 *     shops; the shop quotes and the customer approves before work starts;
 *     progress is tracked live. Each shop sets its own prices and parts.
 *   - No prices, turnaround promises, warranty terms, ratings or city claims —
 *     those vary per shop or are not published (see the seo-decisions note).
 *   - Write for the customer with the broken device, not for a search engine.
 *
 * The brands, models and the full list of repair services on each page are NOT
