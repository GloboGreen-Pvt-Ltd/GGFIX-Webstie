/**
 * pickupWorkflow.js — shop-side pickup lifecycle actions.
 *
 *   PENDING -> ACCEPTED -> ASSIGNED -> PICKUP_STARTED -> PICKED_UP -> COMPLETED
 *   PENDING -> CANCELLED, ACCEPTED -> CANCELLED, ASSIGNED -> REASSIGNED
 *
 * This repo is a frontend-only client (output:'export'; every request goes
 * to api.ggfix.in) — the backend lives in a separate service this codebase
 * does not contain. None of the six endpoints below are confirmed to exist
 * in order-service yet, so calls here WILL fail (404/405) until the backend
 * ships them. That failure must reach the caller as a real error — nothing
 * in this file (or its callers) may mark a booking as accepted/assigned/etc.
 * without a genuine 2xx response.
 *
 * assign-pickup is the one call with a confirmed real precedent: the mobile
 * Partner App already posts the same {pickupPersonId, pickupPersonName,
 * pickupPersonPhone} payload to POST /repair-bookings/:id/assign-pickup
 * (src/screens/owner/AllBooking/BookingActionSheets.js, PickupPersonPickerSheet,
 * same order-service). This module still calls PATCH per this feature's
 * spec — if that 405s in practice, switching the method here is the fix.
 *
 * pickup/picked-up is not one of the five endpoints the spec named (the
 * PENDING..COMPLETED chain has six states but only five endpoints were
 * given) — added here, same URL convention, so PICKUP_STARTED -> PICKED_UP
 * has somewhere to go.
